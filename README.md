# Machine Learning Internship at CognoRise InfoTech

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the work I've undertaken during my internship at CognoRise InfoTech in the domain of machine learning. Below, you'll find a summary of the three tasks I've accomplished, along with a brief description of the methodologies employed and algorithms utilized.

## Task 1: Breast Cancer Classification
Objective:
Accurately categorize tumors as malignant or benign based on features extracted from clinical data.

Key Achievements:

- Preprocessed a dataset containing features and labeled examples of breast tumors.
- Handled outliers and created visualization plots for better insights.
- Utilized machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, Linear Regression, Decision Tree 
  Classifier, and Logistic Regression.

## Task 2: Email Spam Detection
Objective:
Classify emails as spam or not spam based on the email content using machine learning models.

Key Achievements:

- Extracted features and visualized the dataset.
- Applied stemming and tokenization to the target variable.
- Performed vectorization of the target variable.
- Employed algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Adaboosting Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Task 3: House Price Prediction
Objective:
Predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and location.

Key Achievements:

- Collected and cleaned a comprehensive dataset with relevant features.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for better understanding.
- Created models using regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and 
  Gradient Boosting Regressor.

  
## General Overview:

- Throughout the internship, I handled dataset cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model creation.
- Used various algorithms, including those for classification and regression tasks.
- Implemented feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
- Each task is well-documented, providing insights into the methodologies and strategies employed.
- Feel free to explore each task individually for a more detailed understanding of the approaches taken and the skills developed during 
  this enriching internship.
